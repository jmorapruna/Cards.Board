# Cards Board
This project is a simple card management system that lets you view, create, modify and delete a set of cards in a persistent way.
Each card has a title, a description and an image provided by a URL.
The cards can be sorted by their titles or descriptions in ascending or descending manner. 

The goal is to showcase frontend development skills in React and other technologies such as Redux, Redux Observable and TypeScript.

### Used technologies
- [React](https://reactjs.org/), including the hooks API
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/)
- [Local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
